# ðŸš• Clustering NYC Taxi Trips using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to discover patterns in real-world NYC taxi ride data using **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**.

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Objective

Segment NYC taxi trips into distinct groups (clusters) based on trip characteristics such as:
- Number of passengers
- Distance and duration
- Fare and tip amount
- Time of pickup

This enables better understanding of customer behaviors, ride types, and potential anomalies â€” all without labeled data.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Source**: [NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elemento/nyc-yellow-taxi-trip-data?select=yellow_tripdata_2016-02.csv)
- **Size**: 100,000+ taxi ride records
- **Key Columns Used**:
  - `passenger_count`
  - `trip_distance`
  - `fare_amount`
  - `tip_amount`
  - `total_amount`
  - `trip_duration` (engineered from timestamps)
  - `pickup_hour` (engineered from pickup time)

---

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preparation Steps

1. Load CSV dataset
2. Filter out outliers and incomplete rows
3. Engineer new features:
   - `trip_duration` from `pickup` and `dropoff` timestamps
   - `pickup_hour` from timestamp
4. Select and scale features for clustering

## ðŸ¤– Model: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

- GMM allows **soft clustering** (each trip has probabilities for each cluster).
- More flexible than KMeans for real-world, overlapping data.
- We selected the number of clusters (k=3) using silhouette scores.

  
Imagine you have a dataset of points, and you believe that these points are generated from several different groups (clusters). But instead of hard boundaries like K-Means (where each point belongs to only one cluster), you want soft boundaries, where each point can belong to multiple groups with different probabilities.

These patterns can support pricing strategies, customer segmentation, or operational planning.
